            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p><strong>Empowering the Nation</strong> was established in 2018 and offers courses in Johannesburg.
                Hundreds of domestic workers and gardeners have been trained on both the six-month long
                Learnerships and six-week Short Skills Training Programmes to empower themselves and 
                can provide more marketable skills. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="center-text">
            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>We envision a world where every student is empowered to succeed in life, not only through academic achievement but also by becoming thoughtful, compassionate, and responsible citizens.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>The SME is an initiative by Precious Radebe to provide skills training for domestic workers 
                and gardeners. Her parents and other elderly relatives were never given the chance to upskill 
                themselves or follow a formal educational qualification, so this training school is her way of 
                supporting similarly affected members from her community. The training she provides upskills
                domestic workers and gardeners by making them more marketable when seeking employment 
                and enables them to be paid at a higher rate because of these additional skills. They can also 
                be entrepreneurs and setup their own small business utilising these newly obtained skills.
                Many employers would like to have their employees upskilled to offer more skilled services to 
                the household.</p>
